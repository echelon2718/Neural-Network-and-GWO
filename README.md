# Neural-Network-and-GWO

The Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) is an optimization algorithm inspired by the social hierarchy and hunting technique of grey wolves. In the context of deep neural network, the GWO facilitates more rapid and efficient convergence than conventional optimization methods. This is because GWO does not involve any differentiation in the optimization process, so it provides less complex computation. The advantage of GWO lies in its ability to navigate and exploit the search space innovatively, diminishing the likelihood of entrapment in local minima and enhancing the speed of learning.



Our findings indicate a marked improvement in accuracy and learning efficiency following the implementation of GWO. In order to prove this, we use the Iris dataset to implement Deep Neural Network. As a result, this method provides great that can match the performance of several robust models such as XGBoost, RandomForest, and SVM for classifying the Iris dataset.
